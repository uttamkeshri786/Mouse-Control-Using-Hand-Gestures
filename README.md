â€¢	In this project, we present an approach for Human-computer Interaction (HCI), where we have tried to control the mouse cursor, movement and click events of the mouse using hand gestures. Hand gestures were acquired using a camera-based on colour detection technique. This method mainly focuses on the use of a Web Camera to develop a virtual human-computer interaction device in a cost-effective manner.
